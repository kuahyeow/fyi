Next (things that will reduce admin time mainly)
====

Cache some common pages, such as "view requests":
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/list/successful

Emails sent to stopped requests should follow RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3834
    Shouldn't bounce message back to Auto-Submitted 
    Should check from address being replied to is valid
    Should set In-Reply-To and References fields
    Reconsider message content given that section in RFC

Factor out "defunct/not_apply" from request_email into own field so defunct
authorities can still have followups to existing requests.

Add help about not adding extraneous or possibly libelous content to
requests or followups. Explain how to write things to avoid libel law.
Perhaps use these house rules:
    http://www.theyworkforyou.com/houserules/

Button for people to say "this status is really quite wrong please
fix it"?

Lots of authorities are starting to complain about how their record looks on
their page - e.g responses not classified by users. That users may classify
incorrectly. Change wording to make it clear statuses are users opinion ?.
* Meanwhile mention in help that authorities can do this
* And ask that they include URL of requests in emails when talking about them

Check up on how the public old request status editing is being used in 
practice. Think about UI a bit more to try and up rate, and UI of
alerts to requester.


Change text so that overdue covers qualified exemption of public interest test being
valid reason for delay.

Allow for deadline extension for schools.


Put the request from address in the database, then change the rule for making it.
* Use maybe words for generated email address? Name of the person and a request
number (i.e. number of that persons request, so there are few numbers)?
julian.todd@section44.whatdotheyknow.com
* Make sure avoid FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS rule in Spam Assassin
* Identify authority by who it is from.
*    It looks like an error generated by GFI MailEssentials, see p62 of chapter
    11 of the manual at http://www.gfi.com/mes/me11manual.pdf which states:
    7. Check if emails contain more than X numbers in the MIME from:
    Frequently, more than 3 numbers in the MIME from means that the sender is a
    spammer. The reason for this is that spammers often use tools to
    automatically create reply-to: addresses on hotmail and other free email
    services. Frequently they use 3 or more numbers in the name to make sure
    the reply-to: is unique.
* People seem to have trouble typing in the request address again

Julian things:
    Fold up the pages a bit more by default?
    Use FOI code from them authority to work out where emails are to go
    Keep FOI code in subject to help them a bit
    Show requests by authority on user page
    Let the user refile ones that have arrived in wrong place
    Second request by same person - tell them to use this email

check-recent-requests-sent probably doesn't work, as exim log lines wouldn't
be load in case where the envelope from gets broken?

Admin button to resend request one off to particular address 
(OR If the address has been cited in correspondence from the authority
let the user send a follow up to it without admin approval.)

Add explicit option for user to select "misdelivered to the wrong request"
and let people move them to the right place.

Give authorities interface for editing their request email address
and resend messages to them

Page cacheing - the cookie setting stops the expires_on caching working well,
as even when not logged in second page you go to isnt serverd from Squid cache.
Maybe change to fragment caching for things like the "view requests" page?
Then will help logged in users too.


Later
=====

Have an interface for users to be able to suggest new authorities and give
their email address (perhaps just have admins validate / approve it)

Let requesters view the uncensored versions of their correspondence (e.g. with
emails in it). Let other people do so with a CAPTCHA?

For followups, have radio button to say is it a new request or followup
Do by uncommenting the "new information" option when writing a followup, so
that it makes a new request

Don't allow sending internal review text twice (although make sure they 
can write followups to internal review)
e.g. http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/reply_to_letter_from_historic_ro

Point all MX records to one server, so can see incoming messages in exim logs also.
Hmmm, but less robust. Run the exim log grabber across all mail servers?

Links to "a response" from timeline aren't to right page any more.

There is some kind of workflow bug, where people send a follow
up THEN mark as clarification needed, and so it emails to remind them when it
doesn't really need to.
e.g. https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/foi/request/show/8773

Change it to store emails as files in the filesystem? For speed.
Should have simpler system for us to upload files sent to us via CD etc.
Currently I have to manually put them in the files directory on the vhost.
Reconfigure Exim to accept larger messages than 50Mb.
Make it so web upload interface copes gracefully with arbitarily large messages
(it causes speed trouble having them in the database right now)

Remove all show_response URLs, and replace with a special version of the
request URL with a new input box at the bottom and a hash link to it?
<< when following links such as "I'm about to send clarification", a
form appears into which the reply can be typed. However, the
previous correspondence in that thread is not shown.
I usually open a new tab to see what was written previously before
writing in the form. It might be useful if the previous
correspondence were instead shown on the page in which the form
appears. >>

When it prompts error_message people to send annotation, maybe just show them
the email address of the error to check then and there?

Graph on admin page is a bit knackered as doesn't cover all the statuses - I think
this means "waiting_response" is unnecessarily stretched out

Should really make replies munge subject of last response, rather than start
afresh with subject - authorities use FOI code in subject as here:
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/causes_of_the_financial_crisis#incoming-12779

If you've already conducted an internal review, at all places 
- when on unhappy/url
- when on not held link
- on the page for the request
don't offer it again.
Example of completed review:
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/request_for_full_disclosure_of_b#incoming-9267

Clock for internal review
    The Information Commissioner has issued a "Good Practice Guidance" document:
    http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/detailed_specialist_guides/foi_good_practice_guidance_5.pdf
    20 days is late
    40 days max.
Fix up the text: "The internal review should take 2-3 weeks for simple cases,
and up to 6 weeks even for complex reviews."
Awaiting internal review overdue state?

Sort requests on user page by status. 
    "For sorting I was just thinking of a generic sort/filter by clicking
    on the header or some such -- I'd probably want to sort open requests
    in order of 'last action'... to quickly see what was most overdue."

Make search know about uncategorised requests and timed out requests. 
And make search able to do *current* status in general as operator.

Ask people for annotation immediately after they have submitted their request
Ask for annotation about what they learnt from request?

I have several email alerts set up. Is there any chance they could include part
(or, preferably, all) of the search criterion in the Subject: line? :o)
(Perhaps do it in the case when only one search criterion makes the mail)

Update annotation help text for new states like internal_review and gone_postal ./views/comment/new.rhtml

Test data dumper that removes sensitive data, but lets trusted people play with
whole database on their own machine without risk of compromise (for Tony)
- can avoid rebuilding emails, attachments etc. sanitized provided we don't
mind leaking out email address ot requests etc. to the trusted person (in contrast
can easily totally remove private emails in the user table)

Search for text "internal review" in followups and add warning if they aren't
using the internal review mode.

CSS / design things
    - The stepwise instruction boxes "Next, select the public authority ... "
      need to look better, and have icons associated with them etc.
    - CSS error on "all councils" page on some browsers
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=424194
    - Spacing on error boxes round form elements. Matthew says:
            Well, the correct thing to do is have the class="fieldWithErrors" on the
            <p> containing the Summary: label and text input box, not have the
            pointless <span> at all, and then it all looks perfect and as you'd
            expect. But I had a look at the code and haven't got the slightest clue
            how you'd do that, sorry, given it appears new.rhtml is printing the <p>
            but some magic Ruby thing is printing the error span.
    - Improve CSS on IE7 for large images in docs
        http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/3289/response/7810/attach/html/3/20081023ReplyLetter.pdf.html
    - favicon.ico would be nice
    - Get Atom feed of search results to include stylesheet for highlighting words in
      yellow somehow
    - The sign in as a particular user form has the button too flush with bottom of page

What happens if you view an address with the captcha, and it is not_apply or
blank?

Would be nice if you try and send or resend from admin interface and address is
set to not_apply, defunct or "" that it deals with it better :) 

When doing search, people often just want it to show the whole page. Perhaps
all listing should just link to top of page, rather than # links for outgoing
incoming, or perhaps just some of them.

Help page improvements:
    Needs to say somewhere in flow that you can make a request privately (I think quite a 
       few people get to us via Google and don't realise that they can)
    Add "Who should I make my request to?" - make flow better after first section, to abrupt now
    I think the advice in this annotation could go into a nice comment:
      http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/berr_response_to_eu_on_phorm_bt#comment-356
    Add "I want to file squillions of requests"
    Reassurance that fees don't happen much
    Add FAQ / unhappy page which explains what you can do if you get no response
      at all and that it might be spam. (err, or somehow reorganise FAQ for this
     in relation to existing mirror image FAQ for officers)
    Some more traditional help such as:
        * Information about how to track requests and RSS feeds 
        * Information about how to contacting other users

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Link the overdue date to an explanation of what bank holidays it skipped etc.
:)

Should probably remove the weekend rule, and be sterner with authorities about
what "received" means. See thread about staff_numbers_and_costs on team@ ad
these two requests:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/staff_numbers_and_costs
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/policy_regarding_body_scans#incoming-1100
Remember to update help:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/about/#days

Show similar requests after you have filed yours - maybe on preview too.

Test code for FOI officer upload
Test code for rendering lots of different attachments and filetypes
Test code for internal review submitting

Protect from CSRF with this in app controller (care it doesn't break anything):
  # See ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection for details
    # Uncomment the :secret if you're not using the cookie session store
      protect_from_forgery # :secret => '<%= app_secret %>'

Look at quote_address_if_necessary in actionmailer's quoting.rb - why did it
not work for the email address with "@" in its name part?

From an email, isn't stripping spaces right.
    "Met Office  sent a response to Andrew Montford (14 August 2008)"
Also should group by the request id for search queries (so all appear
together when request and response mention same term)

Something to check which tags are used but aren't in PublicBody category lists

Catch query parser error, e.g. for this query
    water NOT NEAR "water lane"
Document such errors in acts_as_xapian

Compress the emails in the database
Don't store the cached text in backups

Edits to outgoing/incoming/title won't be reindexed in Xapian (maybe just reindex all once a week)
    And maybe edits to prominence, which is more upsetting
    Never updates cached attachment text unless cache is explicitly cleared (which
    might matter with software updates, or code changes)
This does it all:
$ ./script/clear-incoming-text-cache ; ./script/rebuild-xapian-index

Remove request email address from PDFs (we already do from docs, and we run censor rules on PDFs now)
   http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_of_policing_the_oxford_unio_3
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/5353/response/11911/attach/html/2/Freedom%20of%20Information%20-%20Letter%20Accepting%20Request%20-%2072057594037995214.pdf.html
Take care here, sometimes emails are found by spammers by Google's OCR of
images in PDFs

Renaming public authorities will break alerts on them. For basic alerts the
structured info is there so this should just be fixed. For searches, perhaps
Xapian index should search url_name history as well?


Display and indexing of response emails/attachments
---------------------------------------------------

Failed to detect attachments are emails and decode them:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/malicious_communication_act#incoming-12964

When indexing .docx do you need to index docProps/custom.xml and docProps/app.xml
as well as word/document.xml ? (thread on xapian-discuss does so)

Mime type / extension wrong on these .docx's

    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/chinese_names_for_british_politi

Search for other file extensions that we have now and look for ones we could

    (call IncomingMessage.find_all_unknown_mime_types to find them)

Make tables prettier in view as HTMl, just normal thick borders.
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/1610/response/8093/attach/html/3/2008.10.29%20Reply.doc.html

Render HTML alternative rather than text (so tables look good) e.g.:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/parking_policy
And indeed so links work:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/recycling_levels_in_the_winchest

They are copy protected PDFs. The code in the incoming_message model tries to fix
that by converting them to ps and back, but the content is getting lost when doing, not
sure why. Perhaps instead patch poppler-utils so pdftohtml doesn't respect protection
either (code in pdftotext already has a #ifdef round it)
Some other pdftohtml bugs (fix them or file about them) - possibly can detect some of these
and display a better error?

Detect councils that always send automatic acknowledgements, and notice if they
do not for a particular request? (e.g. Leicestershire County Council)

Interface for when you change your email address - easier to do now with post_redirect.circumstance?

Add tips on using the law, e.g.:
- You can go up and down between local and national - ask local places what
  their policy is, and hwo they are implementing it. Ask national things what
  odcuments set local policies.

Set arbitary alarms, to be alerted when a date set by authority for themselves

Antispam on contact form (a recaptcha presumably, as we have them elsewhere)

Find a way to get corrected email addresses from responses - somehow getting
user to send them in?  "For future FOI requests please email ..."
e.g. as in http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_of_council_website_17#incoming-1870
we found largely by accident.

Rate limit requests using Ratty, with a freeze thing WTT-style, to detect

Heck, may as well give thumbnails of all images, indeed all docs while you're at it :)

In "view as HTML" let people highlight paragraphs, and link to them
